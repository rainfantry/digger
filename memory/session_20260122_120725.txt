[ ] Tick if confident.
Summary: Actors: state-sponsored (espionage), cybercriminals (financial), script kiddies (ego), hacktivists (ideology), insiders (revenge), cyber terrorists (disruption). Vectors: exploits, phishing, malware, insider access, supply-chain. Goals: money, secrets, downtime, publicity, revenge.

**I understand incident response standards.**
[ ] Tick if confident.
Summary: IR standards minimise impact (ACSC plan, NIST SP 800-61 lifecycle: preparation → detection → containment → eradication → recovery). Australia: 12-hour reporting for critical incidents, 72-hour for others to ACSC.

**I understand cyber security frameworks and standards.**
[ ] Tick if confident.
Summary: Frameworks: Essential Eight (ACSC, 8 controls, 4 maturity levels), NIST CSF (6 functions wheel), ISM (ACSC manual), ISO 27000 (ISMS), GDPR (EU privacy). Standards guide risk management and compliance.

**I understand the fundamentals of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber Security Framework.**
[ ] Tick if confident.
Summary: NIST CSF has 6 functions: Govern (policy), Identify (risks), Protect (safeguards), Detect (monitoring), Respond (incident handling), Recover (restoration). Includes profiles (current/target posture) and tiers (maturity 1–4).

- Avoid posting location, birthday, address.
- Use nicknames/fake details; separate emails by purpose.
- Unique passwords per account; disable location tracking.
- Limit audience; sign in with email, not social logins.

**Techniques to protect personal devices (ACSC)**
- Regular trusted updates.
- Multiple backups (offline + online).
- Lock screen (strong password/biometrics + auto-lock).
- Physical security (never unattended).
- Updated antivirus (e.g., Windows Defender).

SECTION 1: INSTALLATION
----------------------------------------------

**Quick paragraph summary (30-second read)**
Installation begins with verifying hardware meets Windows 11 minimums like 64-bit CPU (1GHz, 2+ cores), 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, DirectX 12 graphics, and 720p display—aim higher for performance. Hardening per ACSC includes enabling Defender AV, MFA, firewall, patches, logging, and BitLocker to reduce threats. Methods: upgrade from eligible Windows 10 via Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update; download ISO from Microsoft for media/VM; or use Media Creation Tool for bootable USB/DVD, with license purchase, backups, BIOS boot config, and guided setup.

**Hardware requirements**
Windows 11: 64-bit processor ≥1GHz with 2+ cores, ≥4GB RAM, ≥64GB storage (HDD/SSD), DirectX 12/WDDM 2.x graphics, ≥720p display.
Windows 10: ≥1GHz processor/SoC, 1GB RAM (32-bit)/2GB (64-bit), 16GB storage (32-bit)/20GB (64-bit), DirectX 9/WDDM 1.0 graphics, ≥800x600 display. Exceed minimums; app-specific needs may apply.

## === CONVERSATION ===
George: what is the dealine for reporting cybersecurity incidents ACSC
Digger: Alright, George, if you're too much of a drongo to remember, here's the lowdown. For critical incidents, you've got 12 hours to report 'em to the ACSC. Anything else that ain't so life-threatening, you've got 72 hours. Get your shit together, you lazy dickhead!

And while we're on it, you might wanna bone up on cybersecurity frameworks and standards too. You wouldn't want to be caught with your pants down like a bloody schoolboy when the shit hits the fan, now would ya?

Now, if I were you, I'd start with the Essential Eight, NIST CSF, ISM, ISO 27000, GDPR, and of course, the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber Security Framework. Just remember: protection, detection, response, recovery, mate!

Oh, and don't be a bloody idiot by posting your personal details all over the internet like some clueless goose. Keep your privacy secure or you might end up with more than just a cybersecurity incident on your hands.

Now get off your arse and learn something, will ya? Bloody slacko!
