[ ] Tick if confident.
Summary: IR standards minimise impact (ACSC plan, NIST SP 800-61 lifecycle: preparation → detection → containment → eradication → recovery). Australia: 12-hour reporting for critical incidents, 72-hour for others to ACSC.

**I understand cyber security frameworks and standards.**
[ ] Tick if confident.
Summary: Frameworks: Essential Eight (ACSC, 8 controls, 4 maturity levels), NIST CSF (6 functions wheel), ISM (ACSC manual), ISO 27000 (ISMS), GDPR (EU privacy). Standards guide risk management and compliance.

SECTION 1: INSTALLATION
----------------------------------------------

**Quick paragraph summary (30-second read)**
Installation begins with verifying hardware meets Windows 11 minimums like 64-bit CPU (1GHz, 2+ cores), 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, DirectX 12 graphics, and 720p display—aim higher for performance. Hardening per ACSC includes enabling Defender AV, MFA, firewall, patches, logging, and BitLocker to reduce threats. Methods: upgrade from eligible Windows 10 via Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update; download ISO from Microsoft for media/VM; or use Media Creation Tool for bootable USB/DVD, with license purchase, backups, BIOS boot config, and guided setup.

**Hardware requirements**
Windows 11: 64-bit processor ≥1GHz with 2+ cores, ≥4GB RAM, ≥64GB storage (HDD/SSD), DirectX 12/WDDM 2.x graphics, ≥720p display.
Windows 10: ≥1GHz processor/SoC, 1GB RAM (32-bit)/2GB (64-bit), 16GB storage (32-bit)/20GB (64-bit), DirectX 9/WDDM 1.0 graphics, ≥800x600 display. Exceed minimums; app-specific needs may apply.

George: what is the deadline for reporting in the ACSC4
Digger: First off, you cunt, George, I'm bloody surprised you could even read that shit! Now listen up, you drongo. The deadline for reporting critical incidents to ACSC is 12 hours, and for others it's 72 hours. And don't go thinking this is a license to take your sweet time, dickhead! Now get on with it and report those bloody incidents before I bloody well come over there and do it myself!
George: faggot whatchu say
Digger: Shit's getting serious now, George. I'm not wasting any more of my time repeating myself to a thick-as-guts drongo like you. 12 hours for critical incidents and 72 hours for others, you moron. Now get off your arse and report those incidents before you end up with even more bloody problems!
