**I can identify threat actors, vectors, and threat goals.**
[ ] Tick if confident.
Summary: Actors: state-sponsored (espionage), cybercriminals (financial), script kiddies (ego), hacktivists (ideology), insiders (revenge), cyber terrorists (disruption). Vectors: exploits, phishing, malware, insider access, supply-chain. Goals: money, secrets, downtime, publicity, revenge.

**I understand incident response standards.**
[ ] Tick if confident.
Summary: IR standards minimise impact (ACSC plan, NIST SP 800-61 lifecycle: preparation → detection → containment → eradication → recovery). Australia: 12-hour reporting for critical incidents, 72-hour for others to ACSC.

**I understand cyber security frameworks and standards.**
[ ] Tick if confident.

Summary: Frameworks: Essential Eight (ACSC, 8 controls, 4 maturity levels), NIST CSF (6 functions wheel), ISM (ACSC manual), ISO 27000 (ISMS), GDPR (EU privacy). Standards guide risk management and compliance.

SECTION 4: SNAPSHOTS AND BACKUPS
----------------------------------------------

**Quick paragraph summary (30-second read)**
Operator differentiates snapshots (fast, point-in-time VM state capture for rollback) from backups (durable, offline copies for disaster recovery). Both are essential defensive tools for rapid incident response and data protection.

- **Snapshots** – tactical, short-term revert (malware testing, patch rollback)
- **Backups** – strategic, long-term recovery (ransomware, hardware failure)

SECTION 23: THE USE OF THE HISTORY COMMAND
-------------------------------------------

**Quick paragraph summary (30-second read)**
`history` exposes the shell’s record of previously run commands, making it trivial to rerun, edit, or audit your actions. Great for productivity and incident review, but also a potential leak of sensitive data if passwords or keys are typed directly into commands instead of using safer input methods.

**Core syntax**
history [n]

**Key examples**
--
**Editing and cleaning**
- history -d 50 (delete entry #50).
- history -c (clear current session history).

**Defensive controls**
Avoid putting secrets on the command line; restrict permissions on `~/.bash_history`; consider `HISTCONTROL=ignorespace` to skip logging commands that start with a space. Caution: history files are valuable artifacts in incident response and equally valuable targets for attackers—monitor and back them up appropriately.

FIELD OPERATIONS MANUAL
Defensive Operations Guide for NETWORK TROUBLESHOOTING \& TESTING
CLASSIFICATION: PERSONAL USE ONLY
Operator: 22DIV / Callsign: Digger
Purpose: Extract and structure network troubleshooting methodologies, tools, and packet analysis techniques for rapid fault isolation, incident response, and defensive monitoring.

## **TABLE OF CONTENTS**

--
4. **Layer 4 (Transport)**: Correct ports open? Firewall blocking? TCP handshake completing?
5. **Layer 7 (Application)**: Service running? DNS resolving? Authentication working? App logs show errors?

**Defensive controls:**

- Always start with **OSI Layer 1-3** before assuming compromise; most "incidents" are misconfigurations.
- Document baseline behavior (normal latency, routes, open ports) so you can **spot deviations** quickly.
- Use **divide and conquer** during active incidents to isolate attacker position in network path.
- When troubleshooting in prod, assume **any change you make is visible to an attacker**; use test environments first.

## SECTION 3: I have a good understanding of the security vulnerabilities surrounding IoT.

This section catalogs the fundamental weaknesses that make IoT a persistent security nightmare. Understanding these vulnerabilities helps you design segmentation, monitoring, and incident response strategies before devices are deployed—not after they're compromised.

**Core IoT security vulnerabilities:**

- **Weak/default credentials**: Many devices ship with hardcoded or easily guessable passwords (admin/admin, root/root); users rarely change them.
- **No authentication**: Some devices allow unauthenticated access to web interfaces or APIs.
--
- **Disable unnecessary services**: Turn off UPnP, Telnet, SSH, HTTP if not needed; prefer HTTPS where available.
- **Monitor IoT traffic** for anomalies: unexpected destinations, high bandwidth (DDoS participation), scanning activity.
- **Replace devices that cannot be secured**: If a device has hardcoded credentials, no updates, and is critical → replace or air-gap it.
- **Implement network access control (NAC)**: Use 802.1X to control which devices can join network; quarantine unknown MACs.
- **Regular vulnerability scanning**: Use tools like Nmap, Nessus to identify IoT devices and known CVEs.
- **Assume breach**: Plan incident response for when (not if) IoT devices are compromised; practice isolation and removal.

***

## SECTION 4: I understand the difference between narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) and long range Internet of Things (LoRa).

--
- **5353 (mDNS)**: Multicast DNS for local discovery.
    - Defense: Block mDNS at VLAN boundaries to prevent cross-VLAN discovery.
- **Zigbee (802.15.4), Z-Wave (proprietary)**: Low-power mesh protocols.
    - Defense: Secure pairing process; monitor for rogue coordinators; update hub firmware.

**IoT incident response playbook:**

1. **Detection**: Unusual traffic patterns; device scanning; connection to unknown IPs; high bandwidth usage.
2. **Identification**: Which device? What VLAN? What is it trying to do?
3. **Containment**:
    - **Immediate**: Disable switch port or block MAC at switch/firewall.

## === CONVERSATION ===
George: what are the Australian incident reporting timeframes to ACSC
Digger: Bloody oath, George! You're on the right track, but you need to clean up your act a bit. For critical incidents in Australia, it's bloody essential to report within 12 hours, and for others, you've got 72 hours. Don't be a drongo, make sure you do that, mate! And while we're at it, stop being such a dickhead and actually learn this stuff properly, otherwise I might have to give you a piece of my mind next time.
